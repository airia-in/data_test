Verghese Kurien, often called the 'Father of the White Revolution' in India, joined the cooperative in 1949. His leadership transformed Amul into a global model for the dairy industry.\n\n\r\n\tUnder him, Amul launched Operation Flood, the world's largest dairy development programme, which significantly increased milk production and established India as the world's largest milk producer.\n\n\r\n\tMother Dairy\u2019s foray into Indian dairy market\n\n\r\n\tMother Dairy, a prominent player in India\u2019s dairy sector, traces its roots back to the 1970s when it was established as part of the ambitious 'Operation Flood' program launched in 1974. It currently operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).\n\n\r\n\tInitiated under the 'Operation Flood', the world's largest dairy development program aimed at transforming India into a self-sufficient milk-producing nation, Mother Dairy was born.\n\n\r\n\tRenowned for its diverse product range, Mother Dairy produces and markets various milk and milk-derived products, including cultured items, ice creams, paneer, and ghee, all under the trusted 'Mother Dairy' brand.\n\n\r\n\tExpanding its offerings, the company has diversified into other segments, such as edible oils marketed under the 'Dhara' brand, and fresh fruits, vegetables, frozen produce, unpolished pulses, pulps, concentrates, etc., under the 'Safal' brand.\n\n\r\n\tIn the Delhi-NCR area alone, Mother Dairy's daily sales exceed 3.5 million litres of fresh milk, including both pouched and token milk.",

        "content": "\r\n\tSweltering heatwave in north India that have caused scores of deaths, floods and landslides in the northeast that have affected lakhs of people, a spring season that suggests it could soon \"disappear\" from the calendar extreme weather events in the first five months of 2024 have got everyone questioning: where is all this headed?\n\r\n\tDespite having made predictions to this effect, climate scientists acknowledge that the temperatures this summer, including the outlier 52.9 degrees Celsius in Delhi, are \"alarming, though not surprising\".\n\r\n\t\"This could be the worst summer in the last 120 years, at least for north India. Never have temperatures gone so high more than 45-47 degrees Celsius for such a vast region, which is also densely populated. This is a record in itself,\" Vimal Mishra, Vikram Sarabhai Chair Professor, Civil Engineering and Earth Sciences, IIT Gandhinagar, told PTI. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp\n\r\n\tThe temperatures, \"similar to those in Africa's Sahara desert,\" are \"far beyond expectations\" by at least three or four degrees, according to Mishra.\n\r\n\tEarth system scientist Raghu Murtugudde, professor at IIT-Bombay, told PTI this was due to the combined effect of multiple phenomena - climate change, El Nino and the water vapour released by Tonga's Hunga Tonga volcanic eruption in January 2022.\n\r\n\tEl Nino causes a warming of the sea surface temperatures, affecting the world's weather.\n\r\n\t\"The Middle East is getting hotter very fast because the desert traps the heat during global warming warmer atmosphere is more humid and water vapour is a greenhouse gas,\" Murtugudde said.\n\r\n\t\"This warming is causing winds over the Arabian Sea to shift northward during summer itself and also during the monsoon. These winds are also warming the Arabian Sea very fast and bringing more humid air to Delhi, thereby raising the heat index.\n\r\n\t\"However, adding fuel to fire is Delhi's killer urban heat island effect, which amplifies the misery,\" said Murtugudde. The effect is caused by built-up surfaces in cities, made of concrete and asphalt, that store heat during the day and release it when the temperature cools in the evening. This heat doesn't escape to space but bounces around between buildings and inhibits nighttime cooling.Also ReadSahara Group threatens legal action over 'Scam 2010' web series controversySouthwest monsoon arrives in Kerala, says IMD: Here is what it meansIMD weather forecast today: Heatwave in 11 states, rainfall in north-eastRed Sea crisis: Implications of Houthi attacks on global trade, securityIPL 2024, RCB vs CSK: Bengaluru weather hourly forecast & rain predictionPuri firecracker explosion: 2 more succumb to burns, toll mounts to 11Air India's Delhi-Vancouver flight takes off after delay of 22 hoursHyderabad ceases to be common capital of Telangana, Andhra from todayLaunch pads across LoC active, 70 terrorists waiting to infiltrate: J&K DGPPM Modi to chair seven meetings on 100-day agenda, cyclone Remal today\n\r\n\tMishra said such extreme heat has wide-ranging consequences on public health, electricity, water and the economy.\n\r\n\tStudies have linked longer, intense heatwaves to a rise in hospitalisations, premature births and also adverse outcomes such as miscarriages in pregnant women. Research has also projected a rise in inflation and a decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across the world due to climate change.\n\r\n\tOn May 29, the day Delhi's Mungeshpur station recorded the exceptional maximum temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius, the city's power demands peaked to an all-time high of 8,302 megawatts.\n\r\n\tEven as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is examining the reading for possible errors, regardless, the day's maximum temperature of 46.8 degrees Celsius, recorded at the primary weather station Safdarjung Observatory, is a 79-year high. It broke the previous record of 46.7 degrees Celsius, registered on June 17, 1945.\n\r\n\tThe Delhi Fire Services, on May 29, received information regarding over 200 incidents, of which 183 were fire-related the highest for a single day so far this year. The national capital is also suffering from a water crisis, with people jumping queues to get water from tankers. This is Delhi's driest May in 10 years.\n\r\n\tThe hottest temperatures in the country for the day, however, registered from Haryana's Rohtak and Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj - 48.8 degrees Celsius - an all-time high of maximum temperatures in the cities for May. The previous highest maximum temperatures ever for Rohtak and Prayagraj were 47.2 degrees Celsius and 48.4 degrees Celsius, respectively, recorded on June 6, 1995, and May 30, 1994, respectively.\n\r\n\tUna in Himachal logged a 19-year high of 46 degrees Celsius, breaking its previous record of 45.2 degrees seen in June 2005, May 2013 and June 2019. Maximum temperatures in the state were firmly six to eight degrees above normal, with Shimla also registering its highest this season at 31.7 degrees Celsius on May 29.\n\r\n\tThe week also saw flash floods in Assam and Manipur, and landslides in Mizoram and Meghalaya triggered by Cyclone Remal. At least 6 lakh people have been affected by it.\n\r\n\tMurtugudde explains, \"Remal stayed intact on land longer because of heat from the Bay of Bengal (a consequence of El Nino) and the land still wet from pre-monsoon rain. That extracted a lot of rain from the cyclone and there are always human factors on hills.\"\n\r\n\tThe sweltering heatwaves in the north and the floods in the northeast were \"not surprising since monsoon comes into the south and heatwaves exit from the north. Late-season cyclones are related to ocean warming and wind changes,\" he said.\n\r\n\tAgainst the backdrop of sharply rising temperatures in March, with Delhi recording maximum temperatures in the mid-to-late 20s, analyses from the US-based Climate Central showed that climate change was shrinking India's spring season, with winters quickly transitioning to summer-like conditions.\n\r\n\tIn many northern regions of the country, the \"spring season is disappearing,\" the researchers said.\n\r\n\tThey also showed that increasingly more states, including Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, faced the likelihood of experiencing over 40 degrees Celsius temperatures in late March, which used to be about five per cent in the 1970s and in fewer states.\n\r\n\tTemperatures continued to rise firmly in April, with above-normal temperatures being recorded in parts of Jodhpur and Bikaner in Rajasthan at 40-42 degrees Celsius, and in Goa at 33-35 degrees Celsius.\n\r\n\tOn April 17, Mumbai's high of 39.7 degrees Celsius was the warmest ever for the month in the last 14 years. The previous high of 40.6 degrees Celsius was seen on April 2, 2009.\n\r\n\tBy April 21, heatwave to severe heatwave conditions spread to Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal, Vidarbha, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, with maximum temperatures in the range 40-46 degrees Celsius, 4-6 notches above normal. By the end of the month, more southern regions, including Kerala, came under the heatwave's grip.\n\r\n\tThe heatwave, part of a larger one impacting billions across South and Southeast Asia, was made about 45 times more likely and 0.85 degrees Celsius hotter due to climate change, scientists from the World Weather Attribution group found.\n\r\n\tAccording to the European Union's climate agency, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), it was the warmest April ever, making it the 11th consecutive month with record global average temperatures.\n\r\n\tEl Nino and human-induced climate change together have fuelled the row of record global temperatures, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).\n\r\n\tThe UN's climate agency also found the current El Nino event to be among the five strongest ones on record.\n\r\n\tGiven its notorious track record, we need to be on alert for the El Nino years, according to the climate scientists.\n\r\n\tFurther, with monsoons ahead and La Nia predicted, they are expecting a cooling effect to set in, but not right away.\n\r\n\t\"I expect this dry heat to continue into June, with intermittent relief, if a weak monsoon prevails over north India during the month,\" said Mishra.\n\r\n\tMurtugudde said that cooling from such a record high could happen over the coming year.\n\r\n\t\"La Nia should begin to pump the heat into the ocean and even if it's a normal year, the tropical Pacific Ocean will begin to take up heat,\" he said.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

For example, in narcotics, you know one can reverse the cycle but it would take quite a bit of effort for some more time to be able to conclusive say that we have been able to plug it for good,\" he added.\n\r\n\tSwain also underscored the importance of collective efforts in safeguarding the border region, saying the police, Army and other security forces were resolutely committed to making it increasingly difficult for the adversary to succeed in their nefarious activities.Also Read2 drone-dropped packets with explosives, cash seized near LoC in JammuIndia, Kenya ink 5 pacts, govt announces $250 mn LoC for Kenyan agri sectorSBI to sign $165 million LoC with World Bank for rooftop solar projectsIslamic State group poses rising threat in Africa despite progress: UNPoonch ambush: Security forces initiate fresh searches along IB, LOCPM Modi to chair seven meetings on 100-day agenda, cyclone Remal todayOne injured, 30 rescued in major fire at high-rise in Mumbai's BycullaPune car crash: Police form over 12 teams to investigate multiple aspectsAssam flood death toll rises to 15, over 600,000 affected by heavy rainsTrain passengers' problems continue on second day of Mumbai mega block(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Uranus and Neptune, as always, are too faint to be seen with naked eyes. Venus will appear too close to the Sun,\" added Ramanujam.\n\r\n\tHe also dismissed the buzz on social media that the planets are aligned in a straight line only on June 3.\n\r\n\t\"The orbits of the planets around the Sun are roughly in the same plane, and each of them are inclined by only a few degrees from the Ecliptic (Earth's orbit). Hence, when seen from the Earth, the planet positions will be roughly along a plane at all times,\" said Ramanujam.\n\r\n\tHe also said this event cannot be termed as rare as such alignments can be seen every few years.\n\r\n\t\"The occasions where more than three to four planets are on one side of the Sun, and are closer to each other than usual, are called planet parades,\" he explained.Also ReadWhy Republic Day parade is celebrated on the Kartavya path every year?Republic Day 2024 parade: 5 special things to watch out for this yearRepublic Day 2024: When and where to watch the telecast of parade liveRepublic Day parade tableaux feature Ram Lalla, 500-yr-old 'Mother Market'76th Army Day 2024: Army Day parade takes place in Lucknow, check updatesIMD forecasts heavy rainfall in coastal Andhra Pradesh for next two daysCM Kejriwal to return to Tihar jail on June 2 as court denies further bailSevere flooding hits Kerala, Assam due to two cyclonic systems: CWCWater level of Brahmaputra rises after incessant rainfall in parts of AssamDeaths rising, govt must declare heatwave 'national calamity': Rajasthan HC\n\r\n\tHowever, rare or not, it is always a treat to see the planets with our naked eyes, admitted Ramanujam. \"It really is a pretty sight.

The next day, the Nagpur weather station reported the mercury rising to 56 degrees, causing nationwide concern. Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp\n\n\r\n\tThe committee tasked with reviewing the anomaly compared these readings with other automatic weather stations (AWS) in Delhi, revealing a positive bias in the temperature readings at Mungeshpur. The AWS at Mungeshpur reported temperatures approximately 3 degrees Celsius higher than standard instruments during peak periods. This means that the peak temperature in parts of Delhi on May 29 was around 49.9 degrees Celsius.\n\n\r\n\tMeteorological officials noted that these high temperatures were recorded because areas like Mungeshpur, Narela, and Najafgarh are particularly susceptible to the early arrival of hot winds from Rajasthan, exacerbating the severe weather.\n\n\r\n\tThe table of maximum temperatures across various AWS and observatories in Delhi showed a significant spike at Mungeshpur (52.9 degrees Celsius) compared to the next highest at Najafgarh (49.7 degrees Celsius). The AWS at Mungeshpur consistently reported higher temperatures than standard instruments, with differences ranging from 1.9 degrees Celsius to 3.1 degrees Celsius.\n\n\r\n\tThe report also noted that no significant discrepancies were found in temperatures reported by other AWS stations in Delhi.\n\n\r\n\tWas Nagpur boiling at 56 degrees?\n\n\r\n\tAdditionally, on May 31, the IMD clarified that the 56 degrees Celsius recorded in Nagpur was due to a malfunction of temperature sensors.\n\n\r\n\t\u201cOn 30th May, PDKV Ramdaspeth (Nagpur City IMD automatic weather station) reported a maximum temperature of 54.4 degrees Celsius, and another station in Nagpur reported 52.2 degrees Celsius. These values are incorrect due to a failure of the electronic sensor (as confirmed by IMD, Pune),\u201d the IMD posted on X.\n\n\r\n\tIt added that at the nearby functioning AWS at the Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR), the maximum temperature reading was 44 degrees Celsius.Also ReadHeatwave scare grows as Nagpur boils at 56 degrees C, all eyes on monsoon52 degrees C in Delhi, 56 in Nagpur put IMD's AWS sensors in the spotlightHeatwave crisis: Mercury at record high in Uttarakhand, J&K, HimachalDelhi's 52.9 to Iran's 66 degrees C: Heatwave are breaking records globallyWas it really 52.9 degrees in Delhi?

Experts pointed out that if maintenance is not proper and the AWS is placed in an inappropriate location, such as a rooftop or over a concrete structure, it can be affected by the nearby topography and overheat.\n\n\r\n\tThey said it was natural for an AWS to overheat, but the scientist who took the reading should have been careful before making it public.\n\n\r\n\tNow, the committee investigating the Mungeshpur and Nagpur incidents has made recommendations regarding the installation and maintenance of AWS. It recommended that corrections be applied in cases of standard bias for accurate temperature representation.\n\n\r\n\tFactory acceptance tests must be conducted at different temperatures during AWS installation. The committee also recommended that site acceptance tests should compare AWS temperatures with standard instruments continuously for at least 24 hours at hourly intervals.\n\n\r\n\tRoutine maintenance of AWS installations across the country and third-party audits should be systematically planned to authenticate data quality, the IMD asserted.\n\n\r\n\tThe ministry has recommended that stringent automatic quality control be applied to AWS data before public dissemination to avoid public panic.",
